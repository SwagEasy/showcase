# Showcase - An easy way to draw attention to specific elements

Showcase is a tiny library that helps you highlight a specific element on a page, by darkening the rest of the page.

## Example

## Usage

```javascript
showcase('#title');
```

## Annotated Source

I used Showcase as an opportunity to check out Docco and Literate CoffeeScript.  To read the annotated source, ~~clone the project and open up `docs/index.html` in your browser~~ check out [showcase.litcoffee](https://github.com/SwagEasy/showcase/blob/master/showcase.litcoffee). It's pretty neat :)
